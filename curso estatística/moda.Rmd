Função que calcula moda
```{r}
mode = function(x){
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
```

```{r}
list = c(1,2,3,4,4,6)
mode(list)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
